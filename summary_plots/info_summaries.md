## info about summary plots

_Note: Some summary plots were adapted from O'Leary et al. (2018)._

First, extract the required info from your vcf file following _vcf_summ_stats.sh_ .
Second, extract per locus info with the custom _rad_meandepth.py_, _rad_missing.py_, and _filter_loci_length.py_ python scripts.
Then, for plotting, use the _summary_plots.R_ script.  You will have to change the file names.
